God is the creator of nations </p><p>“I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and </p><p>earth.” </p><p>So begins the Apostles’ Creed </p><p>It reminds us that God made everything, </p><p>And that includes the nations. </p><p>In Deuteronomy 32:8 Moses speaks to the people of Israel on </p><p>the border of the Promised Land [reader] </p><p>When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, </p><p>when he divided mankind, he set up boundaries for the </p><p>peoples.’ </p><p>Paul echoes Moses’ words in Acts 17:6 [reader] </p><p>From one man [God] made every nation of men, that they </p><p>should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times </p><p>set for them and the exact places where they should live.’ </p><p>In 1947 Sir Cyril Radcliffe was charged with dividing 175,000 </p><p>sq. miles of territory between 88 million people </p><p>The resulting Radcliffe Line now forms the borders between </p><p>India and Pakistan and India and Bangladesh </p><p>But what Radcliffe did in one place at one moment in history </p><p>God does across the world for all people through all history </p><p>Behind the activities of human agents, </p><p>God’s hand has redrawn the maps time and time again. </p><p>It is his hand that has redrawn the European map in the past </p><p>And it is his hand that will redraw the map in the future: </p><p>Whether nations join the EU or leave it </p><p>So first of all, God made the nations. </p><p>And that takes us to our second stop: </p><p>Because God made the nations he also rules them. </p><p>2. God is the ruler of nations </p><p>There has been a lot of talk in the debate about sovereignty </p><p>Politicians on either side have argued about the nature of </p><p>national sovereignty </p><p>And the pros and cons of sharing it with our European </p><p>neighbours </p><p>But in all this debate about human sovereignty </p><p>It’s easy to forget that ultimate sovereignty belongs to God </p><p>As a child I enjoyed playing the board game Risk! </p><p>The game of world domination. </p><p>But the problem with Risk! </p><p>Is that it only took a few wrong moves, some unlucky throws </p><p>of the dice </p><p>And a certain victory quickly became certain defeat. </p><p>Something similar happened with Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom </p><p>He was the most powerful man on the planet </p><p>But in one moment the Lord took everything away - vv29-33 </p><p>Nebuchadnezzar ruled the great empire of Babylon </p><p>But he learnt that even empires do not rule the world </p><p>God brought Babylon down, and God raised it up again </p><p>God alone rules over the nations - vv34-36 </p><p>This is true in the UK, in Europe, in Russia, in the US </p><p>God appoints human rulers for the nations, </p><p>We’ll look at the role of human rulers a little later; </p><p>But first we must remember that God is the ruler of nations </p><p>These two truths that God is the creator and ruler of nations, </p><p>Should be immensely practical truths for us. </p><p>First, we can be comforted because God is in control </p><p>Archbishop Justin Welby recently said that fear is a legitimate </p><p>emotion at times like this: </p><p>There is so much change, so much up for grabs, </p><p>And so much of the future is unknown. </p><p>And yet, so-called Project Fear, should in some senses leave </p><p>us unmoved: </p><p>The past, present and future of the UK and EU is in his hands. </p><p>Be comforted: God is in control </p><p>A second consequence is that we should be prayerful: </p><p>We don’t lapse into fatalism but remember that God uses the </p><p>prayers of his people to bring about his plan. </p><p>And so we can pray ‘Your kingdom come’ </p><p>That God would bring his kingdom in Europe; </p><p>Whether we vote to remain or leave. </p><p>One final consequence is the need to be humble </p><p>We may be convinced one way or the other, </p><p>But we need to express our opinions with humity and </p><p>patience </p><p>Because only God knows the full picture. </p><p>It’s time to come to the next stop in our biblical journey, </p><p>Which focuses on how the nations have responded to God’s </p><p>rule over them: </p><p>3. Nations turn away from God </p><p>Nebuchadnezzar believed he ruled independently of God </p><p>But Nebuchadnezzar’s pride was as old as the tower of Babel </p><p>in Genesis 11 [reader] </p><p>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As </p><p>people moved eastward,[a] they found a plain in Shinar[b] and settled </p><p>there. </p><p>3 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them </p><p>thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for </p><p>mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a </p><p>tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for </p><p>ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole </p><p>earth.” </p><p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+11%3A1-9&version=NIV#fen-NIV-269a"></a><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+11%3A1-9&version=NIV#fen-NIV-269b"></a></p><p>The nations spoke the same language but they wanted a </p><p>deeper unity independent of God </p><p>Instead of honouring God’s name, </p><p>They wanted to be the supreme rulers in a world without God </p><p>God judged the people of Babel, </p><p>And Babel becomes a biblical symbol of all godless empires </p><p>and nations </p><p>Sometimes empires do this by brute strength; </p><p>Something Europe experienced dramatically in the 20th C. </p><p>We should thank God the EU successfully brought peace to its </p><p>member states; </p><p>It was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012. </p><p>But empires do not always wield power violently. </p><p>Godless empires also grow by economic and cultural means. </p><p>Some Christians look at the story of empires in the Bible </p><p>And question whether the EU may be guilty of this; </p><p>Whether its economic expansion is empire building at the </p><p>expense of member states and poorer parts of the world. </p><p>Another empire-related critique of the EU concerns an </p><p>apparent lack of explicitly Christian moral vision. </p><p>It is true that we could say the same thing of the UK, </p><p>But it is the drift from the EU’s founding spiritual vision that </p><p>concerns some people. </p><p>The early European project was based largely on Catholic </p><p>moral teaching encouraged by Christian Democrat parties. </p><p>But this seems to have been largely forgotten </p><p>For example, the Lisbon Treaty speaks of the ‘cultural, </p><p>religious and humanist inheritance of Europe’ </p><p>But does not mention the place Christianity has had in Europe </p><p>over the centuries. </p><p>The EU is clearly not an imperial power in its classic, </p><p>oppressive sense - we have a Referendum after all! </p><p>But we should pay attention to the story of Babel </p><p>Nations and empires turn away from God; </p><p>Sometimes obviously, but often in subtle ways. </p><p>This takes us to the next stop on our journey: </p><p>4. Nations are accountable to God </p><p>Today nations are often held to account by international </p><p>bodies such as The United Nations </p><p>But because God rules the nations, </p><p>The nations are ultimately accountable to God. </p><p>Daniel knew this truth so he urged Nebuchadnezzar to </p><p>respond rightly to God - 4:27. </p><p>It took an almighty shock but eventually the king learnt his </p><p>lesson - 4:37 </p><p>One of our great evangelical forebears was acutely aware </p><p>that the nations are accountable to God. </p><p>William Wilberforce campaigned to end the slave trade, </p><p>Because he knew his country was accountable to God. </p><p>Listen to what he wrote to the Freeholders and Inhabitants of </p><p>Yorkshire in 1807: </p><p>the Almighty Creator of the Universe governs the world </p><p>which he has made; … the sufferings of the nations are to be </p><p>regarded as the punishment for national crimes; and their </p><p>decline and fall as the execution of His sentence. … If these </p><p>truths be admitted, and if it also be true that fraud, </p><p>oppression and cruelty, are crimes of the blackest dye … have </p><p>we not abundant cause for serious apprehension? </p><p>Wilberforce believed Britain faced God’s judgement on </p><p>account of the slave trade </p><p>And so he campaigned so vigorously to abolish it </p><p>When we look at our nation or at the EU </p><p>We must remember that politics matters to God </p><p>But on what basis does God hold the nations accountable? </p><p>We need to know how God judges the nations, </p><p>If we are going to make an informed decision about those </p><p>who rule over us. </p><p>Let’s move to the next stop on our journey: </p><p>5. God calls the rulers of nations to pursue justice </p><p>Nebuchadnezzar wasn’t a believer, </p><p>But he was still expected to pursue justice - 4:27 </p><p>And today God still calls the rulers of the nations to pursue </p><p>justice </p><p>Christians have tended to apply this principle in two models </p><p>of government: </p><p>One is more hands-off and sees the task of government </p><p>mainly in terms of responding to sin and executing judgement </p><p>Such a view is supported by texts such as Romans 13:4 </p><p>[reader] </p><p>rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s </p><p>servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the </p><p>wrongdoer. </p><p>The other model is more hands-on and argues for a more </p><p>directive role for government: </p><p>One that actively creates structures that help society flourish. </p><p>Passages such as 1 Timothy 2:1-4 provide support for this </p><p>view [reader] </p><p>I urge then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession </p><p>and thanksgiving be made for all people - for kings and all </p><p>those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives </p><p>in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God </p><p>our Saviour, who wants all people to be saved and to come </p><p>to a knowledge of the truth </p><p>These two strands of Christian thought differ in the exact </p><p>roles they expect of government: </p><p>But they are agreed on the principle that God calls the rulers </p><p>of nations to pursue justice </p><p>The EU model is more hands-on than hands-off </p><p>And whilst many of its laws are undergirded by a concern for </p><p>justice and the common good, </p><p>Some Christians are concerned that the extensive and </p><p>bureaucratic nature of EU law, </p><p>Makes it hard to assess against the more general standards of </p><p>law as revealed in the Bible. </p><p>But the same applies to most modern systems of </p><p>government, including Westminster </p><p>And so rather than asking whether the EU is compatible with </p><p>a Christian view of government, </p><p>It is better to ask whether the EU helps member states fulfil </p><p>their common calling to promote justice </p><p>We can consider this question in three areas of EU life: </p><p>The first is known as subsidiarity </p><p>Subsidiarity is a Christian concept which says that stronger </p><p>parts of society should support the weaker parts </p><p>Positively, we may look at European mechanisms which </p><p>promote justice and the common good such as: </p><p>Sustainable development and improved working conditions </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="44"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="46"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="47"><span data-reactid="48"><!-- react-empty: 49 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="50"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="51">Sermon on &#x27;The EU referendum : what would Jesus do?&#x27; by Andy O&#x27;Brien</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="54"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
