High Noon in Lusaka</h1><p>The Anglican Communion has a long history, but despite centuries of some form of life, not until the 19th century did an actual Communion begin to emerge. Before that time, there were merely chaplaincies (both military and ex-pat) and a few indigenous churches springing up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/91a928325834a6ed711d500a027f6a448e3131dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 tips for enjoying the church prayer meeting | The Good Book Blog</h1><p>It can be helpful if the person running the prayer meeting sometimes gives a few moments for anyone who hasn't yet prayed to do so.

Avoid praying for everything.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e2482a680b57b99cbd36453153a0496bc1420527.jpg"></article>]]></description>

My rising energy has nothing to do with their policies or character. It has to do with the incredible fact that all of them want to spend their seventies doing the hardest job in the world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/27d097d11b7ff22ff5e0f9de87603845bc54946e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
