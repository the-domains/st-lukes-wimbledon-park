            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hillary, Bernie, Donald, and Me</h1><p>At 70, I am energized to dream great things, because this year Hillary turns 69, Bernie turns 75, and Donald turns 70. My rising energy has nothing to do with their policies or character. It has to do with the incredible fact that all of them want to spend their seventies doing the hardest job in the world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/27d097d11b7ff22ff5e0f9de87603845bc54946e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In defence of the Archbishop (and why the Bible isn't sexist)</h1><p>Some of my fellow students took issue with what the Archbishop said about women, but they've misrepresented him. And I can testify to just how completely unconstrained I feel my faith has rendered me as a 17-year-old girl and feminist, writes Paige Katay. I am a 17-year-old girl.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d27e1c0dd32ca5b6528a904116168755153886d3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
