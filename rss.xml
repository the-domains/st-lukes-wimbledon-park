It is not horrifying like the carnage of war. It's horrifying like the carnage of a culture that is committing slow-motion suicide. The essay documents a civilization-wide calamity on a scale that we have not seen before.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/162e35c1da35fedd3a5de996e2a0f5a009f5e098.jpg"></article>]]></description>
