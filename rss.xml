            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Privilege of Christian Friendships</h1><p>Having a friend who is a Christian is a great blessing but having a Christian friendship is even better. I know a lot of Christians. I might even say I have a lot of Christian friends. But, I don't think I have a lot of Christian friendships. Let me explain the difference.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8803c307bf795f3517a217a2a312ea9120ce381e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3 things that keep men out of the Church - Premier Christianity</h1><p>I'm sure it isn't just me that has noticed, but the Church has a distinct lack of young men. Some have blamed the 'feminisation of the church' for this, citing (among other things) 'Jesus-is-my-boyfriend' worship songs. But I think that there are also some problems within masculinity in our culture that produce barriers to Christian faith.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9f76a01866af0aca394cc3c995df7a51705675bf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Guest Blog - Dr R.T. Kendall</h1><p>This is the most important Blog I have written in many years. I pray with all my heart that this will be read and spread to ordinary Christians all over the world. I cannot come close in emphasising how important this particular Blog is. A melancholy fact: most Christians do not have a Bible reading plan.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/404f7c39665c31449324aa82d8f1e1ceb607c302.jpg"></article>]]></description>
