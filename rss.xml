            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Darkness of Porn and the Hope of the Gospel</h1><p>TIME magazine has published one of the saddest, most horrifying cover stories I have ever read. It is not horrifying like the carnage of war. It's horrifying like the carnage of a culture that is committing slow-motion suicide. The essay documents a civilization-wide calamity on a scale that we have not seen before.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/162e35c1da35fedd3a5de996e2a0f5a009f5e098.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to answer difficult questions with help from Captain Kirk | The Good Book Blog</h1><p>For many people these are slam-dunk arguments that enable them to dismiss the Bible, the God of the Bible and the Christian faith without further thought.

High Noon in Lusaka</h1><p>The Anglican Communion has a long history, but despite centuries of some form of life, not until the 19th century did an actual Communion begin to emerge. Before that time, there were merely chaplaincies (both military and ex-pat) and a few indigenous churches springing up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/91a928325834a6ed711d500a027f6a448e3131dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 tips for enjoying the church prayer meeting | The Good Book Blog</h1><p>It can be helpful if the person running the prayer meeting sometimes gives a few moments for anyone who hasn't yet prayed to do so. Those who are more experienced at praying in public can also encourage new and nervous Christians. Why not model simple one-sentence prayers? Avoid praying for everything.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e2482a680b57b99cbd36453153a0496bc1420527.jpg"></article>]]></description>

My rising energy has nothing to do with their policies or character. It has to do with the incredible fact that all of them want to spend their seventies doing the hardest job in the world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/27d097d11b7ff22ff5e0f9de87603845bc54946e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
