description: '"The twentieth century," according to Scott Sunquist, "surprised the religionists, the historians, and the politicians." He explains: No scholar-or as far as that goes, not even a madman-predicted that at the end of the twentieth century Christianity would not be recognized even as a cultural factor in Europe by the nations that today compose the European Union.'
