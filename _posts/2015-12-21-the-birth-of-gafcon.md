description: 'The Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) was held in June 2008. Over eleven hundred Anglican Bishops, clergy and laity met for a week in Jerusalem. Many of the Bishops chose to attend this assembly rather than the official, once in a decade Lambeth Conference, which was held a few weeks later in Canterbury, England.'
