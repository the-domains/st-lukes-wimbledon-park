description: "I'm sure it isn't just me that has noticed, but the Church has a distinct lack of young men. Some have blamed the 'feminisation of the church' for this, citing (among other things) 'Jesus-is-my-boyfriend' worship songs. But I think that there are also some problems within masculinity in our culture that produce barriers to Christian faith."
