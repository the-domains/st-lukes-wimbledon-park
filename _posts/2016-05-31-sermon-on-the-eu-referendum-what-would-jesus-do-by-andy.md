Fifth Sunday Special: The EU - What would Jesus do? 

Aim: To encourage people to think Christianly about the EU 

Referendum 

Introduction 

The EU: what would Jesus do? 

Would he speak at a rally to remain? 

Or would he line up alongside those who want to leave? 

Surely the Son of God would have an opinion! 

After all, he had an opinion on the Roman Empire didn't he? 

'Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.' 

In that memorable statement Jesus reminds us that 

There are two dominant ruling authorities in the world: 

The nations and the God of the nations 

We began our service with these words from Romans 12:2 

Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be 

transformed by the renewing of your mind 

God does not want you or me, if we're Christian people, 

To think in the same as everyone else. 

He wants us to approach decisions like the EU Referendum, 

With minds informed by his word and shaped by his Spirit. 

This morning we are going to go on a biblical journey: 

To examine what the Bible says about the nations, 

And the God of the nations. 

Hopefully by the end of our journey, 

We'll feel a little more confident, a little more equipped, 

To assess the politics with a transformed Christian mind 

Before finally casting our vote on June 23rd 

So let's get going: 

Our starting point is this: 

1\. God is the creator of nations 

"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and 

earth." 

So begins the Apostles' Creed 

It reminds us that God made everything, 

And that includes the nations. 

In Deuteronomy 32:8 Moses speaks to the people of Israel on 

the border of the Promised Land \[reader\] 

When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, 

when he divided mankind, he set up boundaries for the 

peoples.' 

Paul echoes Moses' words in Acts 17:6 \[reader\] 

From one man \[God\] made every nation of men, that they 

should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times 

set for them and the exact places where they should live.' 

In 1947 Sir Cyril Radcliffe was charged with dividing 175,000 

sq. miles of territory between 88 million people 

The resulting Radcliffe Line now forms the borders between 

India and Pakistan and India and Bangladesh 

But what Radcliffe did in one place at one moment in history 

God does across the world for all people through all history 

Behind the activities of human agents, 

God's hand has redrawn the maps time and time again. 

It is his hand that has redrawn the European map in the past 

And it is his hand that will redraw the map in the future: 

Whether nations join the EU or leave it 

So first of all, God made the nations. 

And that takes us to our second stop: 

Because God made the nations he also rules them. 

2\. God is the ruler of nations 

There has been a lot of talk in the debate about sovereignty 

Politicians on either side have argued about the nature of 

national sovereignty 

And the pros and cons of sharing it with our European 

neighbours 

But in all this debate about human sovereignty 

It's easy to forget that ultimate sovereignty belongs to God 

As a child I enjoyed playing the board game Risk! 

The game of world domination. 

But the problem with Risk! 

Is that it only took a few wrong moves, some unlucky throws 

of the dice 

And a certain victory quickly became certain defeat. 

Something similar happened with Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom 

He was the most powerful man on the planet 

But in one moment the Lord took everything away - vv29-33 

Nebuchadnezzar ruled the great empire of Babylon 

But he learnt that even empires do not rule the world 

God brought Babylon down, and God raised it up again 

God alone rules over the nations - vv34-36 

This is true in the UK, in Europe, in Russia, in the US 

God appoints human rulers for the nations, 

We'll look at the role of human rulers a little later; 

But first we must remember that God is the ruler of nations 

These two truths that God is the creator and ruler of nations, 

Should be immensely practical truths for us. 

First, we can be comforted because God is in control 

Archbishop Justin Welby recently said that fear is a legitimate 

emotion at times like this: 

There is so much change, so much up for grabs, 

And so much of the future is unknown. 

And yet, so-called Project Fear, should in some senses leave 

us unmoved: 

The past, present and future of the UK and EU is in his hands. 

Be comforted: God is in control 

A second consequence is that we should be prayerful: 

We don't lapse into fatalism but remember that God uses the 

prayers of his people to bring about his plan. 

And so we can pray 'Your kingdom come' 

That God would bring his kingdom in Europe; 

Whether we vote to remain or leave. 

One final consequence is the need to be humble 

We may be convinced one way or the other, 

But we need to express our opinions with humity and 

patience 

Because only God knows the full picture. 

It's time to come to the next stop in our biblical journey, 

Which focuses on how the nations have responded to God's 

rule over them: 

3\. Nations turn away from God 

Nebuchadnezzar believed he ruled independently of God 

But Nebuchadnezzar's pride was as old as the tower of Babel 

in Genesis 11 \[reader\] 

Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As 

people moved eastward,\[a\] they found a plain in Shinar\[b\] and settled 

there. 

3 They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them 

thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for 

mortar. 4 Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a 

tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for 

ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole 

earth." 

[][0][][1]

The nations spoke the same language but they wanted a 

deeper unity independent of God 

Instead of honouring God's name, 

They wanted to be the supreme rulers in a world without God 

God judged the people of Babel, 

And Babel becomes a biblical symbol of all godless empires 

and nations 

Sometimes empires do this by brute strength; 

Something Europe experienced dramatically in the 20th C. 

We should thank God the EU successfully brought peace to its 

member states; 

It was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012\. 

But empires do not always wield power violently. 

Godless empires also grow by economic and cultural means. 

Some Christians look at the story of empires in the Bible 

And question whether the EU may be guilty of this; 

Whether its economic expansion is empire building at the 

expense of member states and poorer parts of the world. 

Another empire-related critique of the EU concerns an 

apparent lack of explicitly Christian moral vision. 

It is true that we could say the same thing of the UK, 

But it is the drift from the EU's founding spiritual vision that 

concerns some people. 

The early European project was based largely on Catholic 

moral teaching encouraged by Christian Democrat parties. 

But this seems to have been largely forgotten 

For example, the Lisbon Treaty speaks of the 'cultural, 

religious and humanist inheritance of Europe' 

But does not mention the place Christianity has had in Europe 

over the centuries. 

The EU is clearly not an imperial power in its classic, 

oppressive sense - we have a Referendum after all! 

But we should pay attention to the story of Babel 

Nations and empires turn away from God; 

Sometimes obviously, but often in subtle ways. 

This takes us to the next stop on our journey: 

4\. Nations are accountable to God 

Today nations are often held to account by international 

bodies such as The United Nations 

But because God rules the nations, 

The nations are ultimately accountable to God. 

Daniel knew this truth so he urged Nebuchadnezzar to 

respond rightly to God - 4:27\. 

It took an almighty shock but eventually the king learnt his 

lesson - 4:37 

One of our great evangelical forebears was acutely aware 

that the nations are accountable to God. 

William Wilberforce campaigned to end the slave trade, 

Because he knew his country was accountable to God. 

Listen to what he wrote to the Freeholders and Inhabitants of 

Yorkshire in 1807: 

the Almighty Creator of the Universe governs the world 

which he has made; ... the sufferings of the nations are to be 

regarded as the punishment for national crimes; and their 

decline and fall as the execution of His sentence. ... If these 

truths be admitted, and if it also be true that fraud, 

oppression and cruelty, are crimes of the blackest dye ... have 

we not abundant cause for serious apprehension? 

Wilberforce believed Britain faced God's judgement on 

account of the slave trade 

And so he campaigned so vigorously to abolish it 

When we look at our nation or at the EU 

We must remember that politics matters to God 

But on what basis does God hold the nations accountable? 

We need to know how God judges the nations, 

If we are going to make an informed decision about those 

who rule over us. 

Let's move to the next stop on our journey: 

5\. God calls the rulers of nations to pursue justice 

Nebuchadnezzar wasn't a believer, 

But he was still expected to pursue justice - 4:27 

And today God still calls the rulers of the nations to pursue 

justice 

Christians have tended to apply this principle in two models 

of government: 

One is more hands-off and sees the task of government 

mainly in terms of responding to sin and executing judgement 

Such a view is supported by texts such as Romans 13:4 

\[reader\] 

rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God's 

servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the 

wrongdoer. 

The other model is more hands-on and argues for a more 

directive role for government: 

One that actively creates structures that help society flourish. 

Passages such as 1 Timothy 2:1-4 provide support for this 

view \[reader\] 

I urge then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession 

and thanksgiving be made for all people - for kings and all 

those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives 

in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God 

our Saviour, who wants all people to be saved and to come 

to a knowledge of the truth 

These two strands of Christian thought differ in the exact 

roles they expect of government: 

But they are agreed on the principle that God calls the rulers 

of nations to pursue justice 

The EU model is more hands-on than hands-off 

And whilst many of its laws are undergirded by a concern for 

justice and the common good, 

Some Christians are concerned that the extensive and 

bureaucratic nature of EU law, 

Makes it hard to assess against the more general standards of 

law as revealed in the Bible. 

But the same applies to most modern systems of 

government, including Westminster 

And so rather than asking whether the EU is compatible with 

a Christian view of government, 

It is better to ask whether the EU helps member states fulfil 

their common calling to promote justice 

We can consider this question in three areas of EU life: 

The first is known as subsidiarity 

Subsidiarity is a Christian concept which says that stronger 

parts of society should support the weaker parts 

Positively, we may look at European mechanisms which 

promote justice and the common good such as: 

Sustainable development and improved working conditions
